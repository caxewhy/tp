**MatchEstate** is a desktop application tailored for **real estate agents** to efficiently manage their clients â€” whether they are buyers, sellers, or both. MatchEstate enables fast matching of buyers to suitable listings and vice versa. While it features a graphical interface, the app is optimized for users who prefer fast keyboard-based interactions using a Command Line Interface (CLI).
